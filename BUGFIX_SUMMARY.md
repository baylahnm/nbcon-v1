# ✅ Bug Fix Summary - Dashboard Chat Issues

**Fixed:** Duplicate conversations + Persistent notifications  
**Date:** January 26, 2025  
**Status:** Production-ready

---

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. Duplicate "New Conversation" Threads
**Problem:** Multiple empty threads created automatically  
**Solution:** Added hydration guard + one-time execution ref

### 2. "New Message" Activity Persists
**Problem:** Dismissed activities reappear on reload  
**Solution:** Added localStorage persistence for dismissed items

---

## 📋 Changes Made

### File 1: `DashboardContent.tsx`
```typescript
// Added isHydrated check and ref guard
const initialThreadCreated = useRef(false);

useEffect(() => {
  if (isHydrated && !initialThreadCreated.current && !activeThreadId && threads.length === 0) {
    initialThreadCreated.current = true;
    newThread('chat');
  }
}, [isHydrated, activeThreadId, threads.length]);
```

### File 2: `ClientRecentActivityFeed.tsx`
```typescript
// Added dismiss functionality with localStorage
const [dismissedActivityIds, setDismissedActivityIds] = useState<Set<string>>(() => {
  const stored = localStorage.getItem('dismissedActivities');
  return stored ? new Set(JSON.parse(stored)) : new Set();
});

const visibleActivities = activities.filter(a => !dismissedActivityIds.has(a.id));
```
