# 🔍 Database Verification Instructions

**Purpose:** Verify all tables are created correctly for the Unified Project System

---

## 🚀 **Quick Check (2 Minutes)**

### **Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor**
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: `joloqygeooyntwxjpxwv`
3. Click **SQL Editor** in left sidebar
4. Click **+ New query**

---

### **Step 2: Run Verification Script**

**Copy and paste this into SQL Editor:**

```sql
-- Quick check for all 6 required tables
SELECT 
  table_name,
  CASE 
    WHEN EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables t
      WHERE t.table_schema = 'public' AND t.table_name = tables_needed.table_name
    ) THEN '✅ EXISTS'
    ELSE '❌ MISSING'
  END as status
FROM (VALUES
  ('gantt_projects'),
  ('gantt_tasks'),
  ('gantt_resources'),
  ('project_charter_sections'),
  ('project_risks'),
  ('project_stakeholders')
) AS tables_needed(table_name)
ORDER BY table_name;
```

**Click RUN** (or press Ctrl+Enter)

---

### **Step 3: Check Results**

**✅ GOOD - All tables exist:**
```
table_name                   | status
----------------------------|--------
gantt_projects              | ✅ EXISTS
gantt_resources             | ✅ EXISTS
gantt_tasks                 | ✅ EXISTS
project_charter_sections    | ✅ EXISTS
project_risks               | ✅ EXISTS
project_stakeholders        | ✅ EXISTS
```

**❌ BAD - Some tables missing:**
```
table_name                   | status
----------------------------|--------
gantt_projects              | ✅ EXISTS
gantt_resources             | ✅ EXISTS
gantt_tasks                 | ✅ EXISTS
project_charter_sections    | ❌ MISSING  ← Need to create!
project_risks               | ❌ MISSING  ← Need to create!
project_stakeholders        | ❌ MISSING  ← Need to create!
```

## 🔧 **If Tables Are Missing**

### **Option A: Run Combined Migration (Easiest)**

**File:** `database/verification/apply-missing-migrations.sql`

1. Open the file in your editor
2. Copy ALL contents
3. Paste in Supabase SQL Editor
4. Click **RUN**
5. Wait for "Success" message
6. Re-run Step 2 verification
7. All tables should now show ✅ EXISTS

---

### **Option B: Run Individual Migrations**

**If only specific tables are missing:**

**Missing `project_charter_sections`?**
- File: `supabase/migrations/20241024000001_project_charter_sections.sql`
- Copy → Paste in SQL Editor → RUN

**Missing `project_risks`?**
- File: `supabase/migrations/20241024000002_project_risks.sql`
- Copy → Paste in SQL Editor → RUN

**Missing `project_stakeholders`?**
- File: `supabase/migrations/20241024000003_project_stakeholders.sql`
- Copy → Paste in SQL Editor → RUN

---

## ✅ **Expected Results After Migration**

### **You should see:**

```sql
-- Run this to verify
SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN COUNT(*) = 6 THEN '🎉 ALL TABLES READY!'
    ELSE '⚠️ Still missing ' || (6 - COUNT(*))::text || ' tables'
  END as status
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
  AND table_name IN (
    'gantt_projects',
    'gantt_tasks',
    'gantt_resources',
    'project_charter_sections',
    'project_risks',
    'project_stakeholders'
  );
```

**Expected Output:**
```
status
------------------
🎉 ALL TABLES READY!
```

---

## 🔒 **Verify RLS is Enabled**

### **Run this check:**

```sql
SELECT 
  tablename,
  rowsecurity as rls_enabled
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
  AND tablename IN (
    'gantt_projects',
    'project_charter_sections',
    'project_risks',
    'project_stakeholders'
  )
ORDER BY tablename;
```

**Expected: All should show `true`**

```
tablename                  | rls_enabled
---------------------------|-------------
gantt_projects             | true ✅
project_charter_sections   | true ✅
project_risks              | true ✅
project_stakeholders       | true ✅
```

## 📊 **Check Gantt Tables (From Phase 1)**

### **If gantt_projects is missing:**

**You need to apply the Gantt migrations first!**

**File:** Look for migration files like:
- `supabase/migrations/20240101000011_gantt_tables.sql`

**Or check your migrations folder:**
```bash
ls supabase/migrations/
```

**Find the Gantt migration and apply it first, then apply the 3 new migrations.**

---

## 🎯 **Quick Diagnosis**

### **Scenario 1: All ✅ EXISTS**
→ **Perfect!** Database is ready.  
→ Test the system now: http://localhost:8080/free/ai-tools/planning

### **Scenario 2: Only new tables ❌ MISSING**
→ Run `database/verification/apply-missing-migrations.sql`  
→ Takes 30 seconds  
→ Then test

### **Scenario 3: gantt_projects ❌ MISSING**
→ Need to apply Gantt migrations first  
→ Check `supabase/migrations/` for earlier Gantt migration  
→ Apply Gantt migration → Then apply new migrations

### **Scenario 4: Everything ❌ MISSING**
→ Fresh database  
→ Apply all migrations in order  
→ Check migration files in `supabase/migrations/`

---

## 🧪 **Test Database Connection**

### **Simple test:**

```sql
-- This should work if database is accessible
SELECT 
  current_user as database_user,
  current_database() as database_name,
  now() as current_time;
```

**If this works, database is connected!**

---

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting**

### **Error: "relation does not exist"**
→ Table not created yet  
→ Run the migration SQL

### **Error: "permission denied"**
→ RLS blocking you  
→ Make sure you're signed in (auth.uid() should work)

### **Error: "foreign key constraint"**
→ gantt_projects doesn't exist  
→ Apply Gantt migration first

### **No errors but empty results**
→ Tables exist but no data yet  
→ This is expected!  
→ Create projects via UI

---

## ✅ **Success Checklist**

**Database is ready when:**
- [ ] All 6 tables show ✅ EXISTS
- [ ] All 6 tables have RLS enabled (true)
- [ ] No SQL errors when running verification
- [ ] You can test the system without errors

**Then proceed to:**  
http://localhost:8080/free/ai-tools/planning

## 🎯 **What You Should See**

### **In Supabase Dashboard:**

**Table Editor (left sidebar):**
```
Tables:
  ├── gantt_projects ✅
  ├── gantt_tasks ✅
  ├── gantt_resources ✅
  ├── project_charter_sections ✅
  ├── project_risks ✅
  └── project_stakeholders ✅
```

**If you see all 6 → Perfect!** ✅

---

## 📝 **Summary**

**What to do:**
1. Run verification query (Step 2 above)
2. Check which tables are missing
3. Apply missing migrations
4. Verify all tables exist
5. Test the system!

**Time required:**
- Verification: 1 minute
- Apply migrations (if needed): 1 minute
- Test system: 5 minutes
- **Total: ~7 minutes**

---

## 🚀 **Let's Get Testing!**

**Once all tables exist:**
→ Go to: http://localhost:8080/free/ai-tools/planning  
→ Click "New Project"  
→ Create your first project
