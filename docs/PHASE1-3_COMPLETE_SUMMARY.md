Applies Riyadh market rates →
Generates professional Excel BOQ →
Engineer reviews (2 min instead of 8 hours) →
Client approves →
💰 Budget saved: 7.75 hours × $100/hr = $775
```

**ROI:** Immediate value, easy to demo

---

### Win 2: Token Usage Visibility (Week 1)

**User Journey:**
```
Engineer uses AI agents all month →
Sees token usage widget in dashboard →
"I've used 45,000 tokens this month (45% of quota)" →
"Top usage: Civil (15,000 tokens), Structural (12,000)" →
Makes informed decisions about AI usage →
Platform can offer "Pro" plan for heavy users
```

**ROI:** Enables monetization, user awareness

---

### Win 3: Real-time Multi-Tab Sync (Already Working!)

**User Journey:**
```
Engineer has dashboard open on desktop →
Opens /free/ai on tablet →
Sends message on desktop →
Message appears on tablet instantly →
"This is amazing! My conversations follow me everywhere"
```

**ROI:** Immediate UX improvement, no additional work needed

### Returns

**Year 1 Projections (100 engineers using system):**

```
Time saved per engineer: 80 hours/month
Value per hour: $100
Monthly savings: 100 engineers × 80 hours × $100 = $800,000
Annual savings: $9,600,000

AI costs (100 engineers):
$500/month OpenAI × 12 = $6,000/year

Net savings: $9,594,000/year
ROI: 4,040%
Payback: 0.3 months (9 days!)
```

**Conclusion:** Extremely high ROI, minimal risk

---

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Workflow Complexity
**Probability:** High | **Impact:** Medium

**Mitigation:**
- Start with simplest workflows (BOQ, load calc)
- Iterate with engineer feedback
- De-scope if behind schedule
- Minimum 9 workflows acceptable (1 per discipline)

---

### Risk 2: Token Costs Exceed Budget
**Probability:** Low | **Impact:** Medium

**Mitigation:**
- Quota system enforces limits
- Use gpt-4o-mini where possible (5x cheaper)
- Monitor daily with alerts
- Optimize prompts to reduce tokens

---

### Risk 3: Mobile Adoption Slow
**Probability:** Medium | **Impact:** Low

**Mitigation:**
- Web-first strategy (mobile is bonus)
- If Week 7 web incomplete, defer mobile to Phase 4
- Mobile enhances but doesn't block launch

---

### Risk 4: Training Data Quality
**Probability:** Low | **Impact:** High

**Mitigation:**
- Start with synthetic/example data
- Require engineer approval (rating ≥4.5) for training
- Peer review training samples
- Gradual fine-tuning (not immediate requirement)

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### **228 Automated Tests**

**Breakdown:**
- Unit tests: 168 (70%)
- Integration tests: 48 (20%)
- E2E tests: 12 (10%)

**Coverage Targets:**
- Functions: >90%
- Branches: >85%
- Lines: >85%

**CI/CD:**
- Run on every commit
- Block merge if failing
- Coverage reports to Codecov

---

### **Manual QA Checklist**

**Before Each Sprint Demo:**
- [ ] Agent selection works on all 3 pages
