   - Desired: Skeleton loaders with smoother transition
   - Priority: Low (cosmetic)

## 🚀 **Key Discoveries**

### 🌟 **Success Story: info@nbcon.org Account**

This account demonstrates that **when the database is working correctly**, the system functions perfectly:

- ✅ Profile has proper engineer role
- ✅ Redirects to `/engineer/dashboard` (not client)
- ✅ Shows engineer-specific features
- ✅ AI Assistant fully functional
- ✅ Professional title displayed

This proves that our **retry logic and error handling improvements work**, and once the database fix is applied, all new signups will work this way!

## ⏭️ **Next Steps**

### To Fix Redirect Loop Issue:
1. Apply `supabase/fixes/011-complete-production-fix.sql`
2. Test sign out again → should redirect cleanly
3. Profile query should complete faster

### To Test Further:
1. Invalid credentials (should show error)
2. "Remember me" checkbox functionality
3. "Forgot password" flow
4. OAuth sign in (Google/Facebook)
5. Multiple concurrent sessions
