# Export: 2.10 — Implementation Roadmap (Section 10)

Source: ../2%2010%20-%20%F0%9F%97%BA%EF%B8%8F%20Implementation%20Roadmap%20(Section%2010)%2029d608c2eef7809bac74fb1797e01082.md

Summary (key points):
- Objective: phased, verifiable rollout strategy from prototype → validation → production → scaling
- Philosophy: incremental, test-driven, data-backed; each phase introduces one functional layer; CI/CD gates; version-controlled docs; reversible rollouts
- Master Roadmap: Phase A (UI Unification), B (Access & Data Model), C (Database Cleanup), D (Testing & Docs), E (Toolbar), F (Stripe), G (Portal Navigation), H (AI Agents), I (Deployment Enforcement)
- System Pipeline: UI → Access → DB/RLS → Testing → Toolbar → Stripe → Portal → AI → Deployment → Production
- Milestones: M1 (monorepo), M2 (layout), M3 (RLS/access), M4 (testing), M5 (toolbar), M6 (Stripe), M7 (tier enforcement), M8 (agents), M9 (E2E), M10 (production v1.0.0)
- Validation Gates: G1 (build verification), G2 (unit/e2e tests), G3 (feature review), G4 (deployment dry run), G5 (production rollout)
- KPIs: test coverage ≥85%, CI success ≥95%, rollback <5min, issue turnaround ≤24hr, uptime 99.9%
- Deliverables: phase map, roadmap diagram, CI/CD workflows, test gates, deployment matrix, milestone docs
