# Export: 2.11 — Post-Launch Monitoring & Continuous Improvement (Section 11)

Source: ../2%2011%20-%20%F0%9F%94%81%20Post-Launch%20Monitoring%20&%20Continuous%20Impro%2029d608c2eef7808e9ec3fe1cd07bcd7c.md

Summary (key points):
- Objective: continuous improvement framework for reliability, performance transparency, rapid iteration; every deployment is a monitored experiment
- Philosophy: observe → analyze → optimize; log all interactions/responses/transactions; KPIs and rollback criteria per feature; auto-learn from production (AI retraining, docs, RLS)
- Observability Stack: Frontend (LogRocket/Sentry), Backend (Supabase/OpenTelemetry), AI Performance (analytics dashboard), CI/CD (GitHub Actions), Uptime (Cloudflare)
- Feedback Pipeline: User Action → Telemetry → Supabase Logs → AI Analyzer → Ops Dashboard → DevOps → Fix/Retrain/Optimize → Redeploy
- Improvement Framework: Detect (Sentry/LogRocket) → Diagnose (Log Explorer) → Design Fix (Linear) → Deploy (CI/CD) → Document (Docs Sync) → Measure (Dashboard)
- AI Feedback Integration: agent logs → prompt tuning; user corrections → retraining dataset; performance analytics → tool optimization; support tickets → auto-prioritization
- KPI Dashboard: uptime ≥99.9%, error rate ≤0.5%, page load ≤2s, agent accuracy ≥90%, retention ≥70%, support response ≤2h
- Review Cycles: weekly QA sync, monthly agent review, quarterly system audit, annual product review
- Deliverables: monitoring stack, log aggregation/alerting, AI Analyzer pipeline, ops dashboard, KPI validation, improvement cadence
