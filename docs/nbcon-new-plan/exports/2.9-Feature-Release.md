Summary (key points):
- Objective: expand from domain-specific agents to federated multi-agent network with cross-functional intelligence and real-time collaboration
- Architecture Expansion: CoPilotHub (dispatcher), Domain Agents (existing), Enterprise Agents (Finance/HSE/Procurement/Admin), Collaboration Agents (cross-discipline bridges), Meta Orchestrator (supervisory layer)
- Agent Network: Engineering (Civil/Electrical/Mechanical/Structural/Survey), Operations (Project Manager/HSE/Maintenance), Finance & Procurement (Estimator/Budget Analyst/Procurement), Enterprise Management (Admin/HR/Legal/Reporting)
- Collaboration Flow: User → Toolbar → AgentRouter → CoPilotHub (multi-dispatch) → Domain Agents → VectorDB → Integration Agent → Supabase → Unified Output Panel
- Expansion Phases: E1 (enterprise agent integration), E2 (cross-agent collaboration), E3 (knowledge unification), E4 (performance/governance), E5 (production deployment)
- KPIs: cross-agent accuracy ≥90%, response time ≤2.5s, integration success ≥95%, adoption ≥70%, quarterly retraining
- Deliverables: AgentRegistry ≥12 agents, CoPilotHub tested, Meta-Router prototype, unified pgvector, QA benchmarks, analytics dashboard
