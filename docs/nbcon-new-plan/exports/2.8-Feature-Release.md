# Export: 2.8 — AI Agent Training Plan (Section 8)

Source: ../2%208%20-%20%F0%9F%A4%96%20AI%20Agent%20Training%20Plan%20(Section%208)%2029d608c2eef780f985acda507203bf04.md

Summary (key points):
- Objective: train and deploy domain-specific AI agents (Civil, Electrical, Mechanical, GIS, Management, Finance, Safety, Admin) via Co-Pilot Toolbar
- Framework: Core Agent (orchestration), Domain Agents (specialized), Knowledge Layer (pgvector), Execution Layer (Edge Functions), UI Layer (toolbar/chat)
- Agent Roles: Civil (design/BOQ), Electrical (load calc), Mechanical (HVAC), GIS (GNSS/LiDAR), Project Manager (timeline/KPI), Finance (forecasting), Safety (HSE), Admin (compliance)
- Training Pipeline: data prep (Supabase extraction + vectorization), fine-tuning (prompt optimization), evaluation (accuracy/relevance/tone), continuous learning (quarterly refresh)
- Integration: User → Toolbar → AgentRouter → AgentRegistry → Agent (context/prompt/memory) → Edge Function → Supabase → Output Panel
- Implementation Phases: P1 (Civil/Electrical prototype), P2 (expansion), P3 (management agents), P4 (feedback loop), P5 (production sync)
- Metrics: response relevance ≥90%, domain accuracy ≥85%, latency ≤2s, adoption ≥60%, retraining every 90 days
- Checklist: registry.json, Base Agent class, domain agents (civil/electrical/survey/management), Edge functions, FeatureGate logic, tests/benchmarks, playbooks
- Risks: prompt drift, context overflow, tier logic errors, latency spikes, insufficient eval data — mitigations via centralized prompts, chunking, validation, caching, QA sign-off
