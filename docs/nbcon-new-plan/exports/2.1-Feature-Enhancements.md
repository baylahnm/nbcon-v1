Source: ../2%201-%20%F0%9F%8E%AF%20Scope%20&%20Goal%20(Section%201)%2029d608c2eef78058b599efc50b47592f.md

Summary (key points):
- Context: single, unified Co-Pilot with plan-gated access (Free→Basic→Pro→Enterprise)
- Objectives: unified layout (AppLayout/UnifiedDashboard/TierAwareSidebar), plan-driven access (`subscriptionTier`, `is_admin`), AI-first workflows (toolbar, agents), CI discipline
- Non-Goals: custom enterprise branding, proprietary fine-tuning, immediate mobile parity
- Personas: Project Owner, Engineer/Vendor, Org Admin (is_admin)
- Platform Scope: Web/Mobile UI ↔ Supabase (Auth/RLS/Edge/Realtime/Storage) ↔ Stripe ↔ AI subsystems ↔ Monitoring
- Success Criteria: no role forks, FeatureGate by tier, Stripe→Supabase sync ≤60s, E2E per tier, docs complete
- North-Star Metrics: activation, upgrade intent, reliability P95, AI quality
- In/Out of Scope: UI unification, access, DB/RLS, payments, AI toolbar; defer mobile parity & white-label
- Acceptance Tests: free vs pro gating, upgrade unlocks, no role forks, RLS via is_admin
- Risks & Mitigations: legacy role forks, webhook delays, RLS regressions, agent bloat
