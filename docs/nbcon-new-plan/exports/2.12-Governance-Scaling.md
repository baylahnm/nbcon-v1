Summary (key points):
- Objective: governance model and scaling structure for sustainable growth with clear ownership, compliance, quality controls
- Principles: Transparency (traceable features/decisions), Accountability (defined domain owners), Scalability (horizontal growth), Compliance (KSA PDPL, Aramco standards)
- Governance Layers: Product (vision/roadmap), Technical (code quality/architecture), AI (ethical use/accuracy), Data (Supabase/RLS/backups), Operational (rollout/risk)
- Governance Flow: Product Ops → Tech Lead → AI Governance → Data/PDPL → QA/Audit → Executive → Deployment → Monitoring → loop back
- Roles: Product Owner, Tech Lead, AI Governance Lead, DPO, QA Engineer, Release Manager with defined responsibilities and tools
- Compliance Controls: PDPL/GDPR alignment (RLS), change log transparency (GitHub/Linear), audit logging (Supabase), data retention (90-day logs, 1-year backups), quarterly access reviews
- Scaling Framework: Horizontal (new agents/tools via AgentRegistry), Vertical (concurrent users/storage), Governance (OWNERS.md, docs, monitoring hooks per module)
- Metrics: compliance 100%, code quality ≤1 blocker/release, AI transparency 100%, zero unauthorized access, governance reviews ≥90%
- Deliverables: OWNERS.md, Governance_Policy.md, PDPL compliance plan, QA/audit pipelines, runbook appendix, quarterly audit cycle
