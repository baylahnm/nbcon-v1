Source: ../2%2016%20-%20%F0%9F%94%92Testing%20&%20Deployment%20Enforcement%20(Section%20%2029d608c2eef7806e914af1b2e0970de1.md

Summary (key points):
- Objective: end-to-end stability and compliance via automated testing, CI/CD validation, deployment gating across all environments
- Core Principles: zero-regression policy, tier enforcement validation, automated deployment (GitHub Actions + Supabase + Stripe), config immutability, governance compliance (PDPL/audit)
- Deployment Architecture: Developer Commit → CI/CD → Tests (lint/type/unit/e2e) → Deploy (Supabase/Vercel) → Migrations + Stripe Sync → Post-Deploy Validation → Alerts/Rollback
- CI/CD Workflows: ci.yml (PR checks), e2e.yml (nightly), release.yml (tag-based deploy), migrations.yml (DB validation), stripe-sync.yml (product/tier parity), monitor.yml (hourly uptime)
- Testing Hierarchy: Unit (Vitest), Integration (Jest/Supabase Mock), E2E (Playwright), Regression (Snapshot), Security (ZAP CLI), Performance (k6/Lighthouse)
- Tier Validation Matrix: E2E coverage per tier for Dashboard, AI Tools, Analytics, Agents, Enterprise Ops, Billing, Upgrade flows
- Deployment Pipeline: Staging Deploy → Migrations → Stripe Sync → Tier E2E/Webhook Tests → Tag Release → Promote to Production → Monitor → Auto-Rollback
- Validation Metrics: E2E pass rate ≥95%, deployment time <4min, rollback MTTR <3min, downtime <0.1%, Stripe sync drift 0%
- Governance Hooks: PDPL compliance script (on deploy), RiskRegister update (weekly), release notes (every release), owner sign-off (on PR), security alerts (continuous)
- Deliverables: CI/CD workflows, tier-aware Playwright suite, Stripe/Supabase sync tests, PDPL compliance script, rollback pipeline, governance logs, health dashboard, Slack alerts
