## 🔍 Check Browser Console

**Open DevTools (F12) and check for:**

**Should see:**
- ✅ "🔍 AIToolsPlanningPage loaded: /free/ai-tools/planning"
- ✅ "✅ Project created and selected: [Your Project Name]"

**Should NOT see:**
- ❌ Import errors
- ❌ Failed to resolve errors  
- ❌ TypeScript errors
- ❌ Network errors (except normal API calls)

**Current Vite Errors (from terminal):**
```
Failed to resolve import "../../stores/useProjectStore"
```

**This is a path issue - I'll fix it now!**

## 🔧 Fixing Import Path Issue

The error shows `CreateProjectDialog.tsx` can't find `useProjectStore`. 

**File structure:**
```
src/pages/4-free/
├── 15-AIToolsPlanningPage.tsx
├── others/
│   ├── stores/
│   │   └── useProjectStore.ts       ← TARGET
│   └── features/
│       └── ai-tools/
│           └── components/
│               └── CreateProjectDialog.tsx  ← FROM HERE
```

**Path calculation from CreateProjectDialog:**
```
CreateProjectDialog.tsx location:
  src/pages/4-free/others/features/ai-tools/components/

To reach useProjectStore.ts:
  Go up: components/ → ai-tools/ → features/ → others/
  Then: stores/useProjectStore.ts

Path: ../../../../stores/useProjectStore
```

**Current (wrong):** `../../stores/useProjectStore`  
**Correct:** `../../../../stores/useProjectStore`

Let me fix this now! 🔧
